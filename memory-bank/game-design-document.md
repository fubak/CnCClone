## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Resource Gathering
- **Resource:** Tiberium, a valuable and hazardous crystalline substance.
- **Harvesting:** Players deploy harvester units to collect Tiberium from fields and deliver it to refineries, where it is processed into credits.
- **Management:** Players must balance resource collection with expenditures on units, structures, and upgrades.

### Base Building
- **Construction Yard:** The central structure that enables the construction of all other buildings.
- **Power Management:** Most structures require power to operate; players must build power plants to maintain a sufficient energy supply.
- **Structure Types:**
  - **Resource:** Refinery (processes Tiberium into credits)
  - **Production:** Barracks (infantry), War Factory (vehicles), Airfield (aircraft)
  - **Defense:** Turrets, Walls
  - **Technology:** Tech Center (unlocks advanced units and upgrades)

### Unit Production
- **Unit Types:**
  - **Infantry:** Riflemen (basic soldiers), Engineers (capture enemy structures)
  - **Vehicles:** Tanks (combat), Harvesters (resource collection)
  - **Aircraft:** Helicopters, Jets (air support)
- **Production:** Units are trained in their respective production structures, with the ability to queue multiple units for efficiency.

### Combat System
- **Unit Roles:** Units have specific strengths and weaknesses (e.g., anti-infantry, anti-vehicle, anti-air).
- **Terrain:** Elevation and cover influence unit movement and combat effectiveness.
- **Controls:** Players can assign units to groups for coordinated attacks and maneuvers.

### Technology Tree
- **Upgrades:** Researching new technologies unlocks advanced units, structures, and abilities.
- **Requirements:** Specific structures (e.g., Tech Center) must be built to access higher-tier technologies.

### Superweapons
- **GDI:** Ion Cannon - A devastating orbital strike targeting a specific area.
- **Nod:** Nuclear Missile - A powerful area-of-effect weapon causing widespread destruction.
- **Mechanics:** Superweapons require unique structures (e.g., Ion Cannon, Temple of Nod) and have a cooldown period between uses.

### Fog of War
- **Visibility:** Players can only see areas within the line of sight of their units and structures.
- **Scouting:** Essential for gathering intelligence on enemy positions, requiring active exploration.

## Factions
The game features two factions with distinct playstyles, reflecting the iconic GDI vs. Nod rivalry from *Command & Conquer*.

### Global Defense Initiative (GDI)
- **Theme:** Advanced technology and defensive prowess.
- **Unique Units:** Mammoth Tank (heavy assault vehicle), Orca (VTOL aircraft).
- **Playstyle:** Focuses on powerful, expensive units and strong defensive capabilities.

### Brotherhood of Nod
- **Theme:** Stealth, speed, and guerrilla tactics.
